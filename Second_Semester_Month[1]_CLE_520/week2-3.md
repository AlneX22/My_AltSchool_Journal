## üí° What I Learned
- I now understand that an **OS** (Operating System) is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. 
- And there are different categories of Operating System in computer and other devices which are: 
  - **Batch Operating System**
  - **Multitasking/Time Sharing OS**
  - **Multiprocessing OS**
  - **Real Time OS**
  - **Distributed OS**
  - **Network OS & Mobile OS**
- Personal Computer Operating Systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage.
- An **OS** works as an intermediate between the user and computer. It helps the user to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer‚Äôs language.
- The kernel is the central component of a computer operating systems. The only job performed by the kernel is to the manage the communication between the software and the hardware.
- Two most popular kernels are **Monolithic** and **MicroKernels**
- Process, Device, File, I/O, Secondary-Storage, Memory management are various functions of an Operating System.
- I also learned about the **UNIX** being the first developed in the 1960's and the **UNIX-like (Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X )** operating system. With Linux in its turn is packaged in a form known as linux distribution. there are several distributions both free and commercial.
- The UNIX operating system is made of **Three(3)** parts
  - **The Kernel:** Is the hub of the perating system. it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the file store and communication in response to system calls.
  - **The Shell:** Acts as an interface between the user and the kernel
  - **The Process:** Is an executing program identified by a unique **PID (process identifier).**
- Everyhting in UNIX is either a file or a process.
- All files are grouped together in the directory structure, and is arranged in a hierarchial structure, like an inverted tree with the top of the hierarchy called **root**
- The different distribution installation hosts of the Linux Operating system **(BareMetals, Virtual Machines, Containers)**
- The installation Hosts **(Virtual Machines):** **VirtalBox, VMWare, Parallels, Hyper-V, Qemu, Citrix**
- Distributon Mediums: **CD/DVDs,ISO Images, Clones, Virtual Machine Images, Container Images, Source Code**
- where to get OS Images: **OS Project website, Code hosting platforms(e.g. GitHub), Community forums, A friend of a friend, Registries**
- Types of Linux Shell: **sh (Bourne shell), Bash (Bourne-again Shell), Korn Shell(ksh), zsh.**
- Also looked at the different linux commands and their uses:
  - **pwd:** Present Working Directory
  - **cd DIR:** Moves you into a directory
  - **ls:** lists the content of a directory
  - **uname -a:** Identify what type of operatng system you are using
  - **date:** Check system date and time
  - **uptime:** Know how long the system has been on
  - **whoami:** Know who is currently logged in
  - **export VAR=VALUE:** Set a variable in the terminal 
  - **echo $VAR:** Display the content of the variable
  - **ps:** View running application
  - **top:** Get detailed info about the processes that are running 
  - **df -h:** Tells you more about the storage that you have
  - **id:** show user ID and group
  - **free -h:** Ram usage
  - **mkdir DIR:** create a new direct 
  - **touch FILE:** Create an empty file
  - **cp FILE FILE:** Copy files between different locations safely
  - **mv FILE FILE:** Cut and paste(move a file) or Remane a file
  - **rm FILE:** Delete a file
  - **cat FILE:** Display the content of a file
  - **head FILE:** Display the top of the file
  - **tail FILE:** Display the buttom or better put the end of a file
  - **vim FILE:** Opens a text editor called **vim** for editing files
  - **nano FILE:** Open a simpler text editor **nano** within you terminal to edit files
  - **man COMMAND:**  Gives you detailed information about a command
  - **COMMAND -h:** Gives a quicker reference of a command
  - **COMMAND -help:** Also gives a quicker reference of a command
