## 💡 What I Learned
- I now understand that an **OS** (Operating System) is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. 
- And there are different categories of Operating System in computer and other devices which are: 
  - **Batch Operating System**
  - **Multitasking/Time Sharing OS**
  - **Multiprocessing OS**
  - **Real Time OS**
  - **Distributed OS**
  - **Network OS & Mobile OS**
- Personal Computer Operating Systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage.
- An **OS** works as an intermediate between the user and computer. It helps the user to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language.
- The kernel is the central component of a computer operating systems. The only job performed by the kernel is to the manage the communication between the software and the hardware.
- Two most popular kernels are **Monolithic** and **MicroKernels**
- Process, Device, File, I/O, Secondary-Storage, Memory management are various functions of an Operating System.
- I also learned about the Unix/Unix-Like Operating Systems
