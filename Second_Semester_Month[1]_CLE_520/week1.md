## 💡 What I Learned

- I now understand that **cloud computing** is about accessing computing resources (like servers, storage, and databases) over the internet instead of on physical devices.
- The **main benefits** of using cloud services are scalability, flexibility, cost efficiency, and accessibility.
- There are **three main service models**:
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** You get raw compute resources (e.g. EC2 in AWS).
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** You get a platform to build and deploy apps (e.g. Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk).
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service):** You use ready-made software online (e.g. Gmail, Dropbox).
- I also learned about the **three cloud deployment models**:
  - **Public cloud** (e.g. AWS, Azure)
  - **Private cloud** (used internally within companies)
  - **Hybrid cloud** (mix of both)

## 😓 Challenges

- It was a bit confusing at first to differentiate between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS — they sound similar, but they serve different levels of control and management.
- I’m still trying to fully understand how companies choose between public, private, or hybrid clouds.
- Understanding real-life examples of deployment models still needs more research and practice.

## 🧪 Practicals or Projects

- No hands-on labs yet, but we were introduced to the tools we’ll use later (like AWS, terminal access, cloud consoles).
- Created a simple drawing showing IaaS, PaaS, SaaS layers (in my notes).
